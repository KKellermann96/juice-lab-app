      "<p> My motivation for this project came from my fascination with building a <span class='font-semi-bold'>3D world on the web</span> and my enjoyment of modeling in <span class='font-semi-bold'>Blender</span>. The idea was inspired by <a class='font-semi-bold underline text-blue-500' href='https://www.jesse-zhou.com/' target='_blank'>Jesse and his ramen shop</a>. When I first saw his website, I was so impressed that I wanted to design my portfolio in a similar style. The project took a little over <span class='font-semi-bold'>six months</span> to complete, as I could only work on it in my free time while being employed at a company. </p> <p> I created all the <span class='font-semi-bold'>3D models</span> myself, drawing inspiration from <span class='font-semi-bold'>Brandon James Greer</span> and his amazing pixel arts, as well as from <span class='font-semi-bold'>Polygon Runway</span> and <span class='font-semi-bold'>Ru’s Blender Diary</span> for their awesome Blender projects on YouTube. </p> <p> The web application was built using <span class='font-semi-bold'>Vue 3</span>, <span class='font-semi-bold'>TypeScript</span>, and <span class='font-semi-bold'>Tailwind</span>. To integrate the models into the web, I primarily used <span class='font-semi-bold'>ThreeJS</span>, a powerful framework that allows for <span class='font-semi-bold'>rendering, manipulating, and animating</span> 3D graphics directly in the browser using WebGL. </p> <p> I am very proud of how this project turned out and hope it inspires others to explore the world of <span class='font-semi-bold'>3D web applications!</span> </p> ",

      "<p> This was my first major project during my studies, and it was a dream come true to create my own game. I've always loved the <span class='font-semi-bold'>2D Jump & Run</span> genre, so I wanted to put my own spin on it by adding creative mechanics and a story. My main goal was to keep the gameplay engaging, even after multiple playthroughs. To achieve that, I implemented <span class='font-semi-bold'>procedural level generation</span>, ensuring that every run feels fresh and different. </p> <p> The game was developed in <span class='font-semi-bold'>Unity</span> using <span class='font-semi-bold'>C#</span>, with all graphics hand-drawn in <span class='font-semi-bold'>Photoshop</span>. For character and enemy animations, I used <span class='font-semi-bold'>bone rigging</span>, which I found to be a fascinating technique. </p> <p> It took me <span class='font-semi-bold'>two years</span> to complete and publish the game. While I had many more ideas planned, like additional levels, enemies, or even boss fights, I might revisit and expand the game in the future. </p> <p> If you haven't played it yet, be sure to check it out at the <span class='font-semi-bold'>arcade</span> where it's available! </p>",

      "<p> The goal of this project was to develop an <span class='font-semi-bold'>interactive network graph</span> for visualizing hydrogen projects and companies while automatically collecting data from various sources. </p> <p> My responsibilities included developing a <span class='font-semi-bold'>software-based knowledge and research tool</span>, restructuring, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets, as well as setting up and hosting a <span class='font-semi-bold'>web server</span> with a <span class='font-semi-bold'>login and registration system</span>. </p> <p> Additionally, I contributed to the conceptual design of a <span class='font-semi-bold'>miniature hydrogen test field model</span> and was responsible for its <span class='font-semi-bold'>LED lighting system</span>, which I implemented using a <span class='font-semi-bold'>Raspberry Pi</span>. </p> <p> I later wrote my <span class='font-semi-bold'>bachelor's thesis</span> in collaboration with Fraunhofer IWES on the topic: <i>'Automated Collection and Analysis of Topic-Specific Web Content Using Semantic Data Mining Methods,'</i> which I successfully completed with a <span class='font-semi-bold'>grade of 1.3</span>. </p> ",

      "<p> During my time at the AI Lab Bremerhaven, I worked on programming the humanoid robot <span class='font-semi-bold'>Pepper</span> to function as a university assistant and deploy it in a practical setting. </p> <p> Together with a small team, we followed the <span class='font-semi-bold'>Scrum</span> methodology and programmed Pepper’s behavior to enable its use as a university assistant. We utilized <span class='font-semi-bold'>AI-powered functions</span> such as <span class='font-semi-bold'>face recognition</span> and <span class='font-semi-bold'>text-to-speech</span> capabilities, and developed a small application for Pepper’s tablet. </p> <p> To display the data collected by Pepper in real-time on a website, we developed a <span class='font-semi-bold'>WebSocket server</span> and visualized the data using <span class='font-semi-bold'>ChartJS</span>. </p>",
